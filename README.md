# Analysis of Economic Growth Impact on Health Outcomes
This project seeks to look into the complex relationship between certain economic indicators and relevant health indicators. Detailed
analysis reveals underlying patterns and correlations, contributing to conversations about health equity, socioeconomic determinants, and policy formation initiatives. To understand both linear and nonlinear links, the project takes a systematic approach that includes numerical summaries, exploratory visualisations, trend
analysis, and modelling. This leads to a better knowledge of how economical factors affect different areas of public health.

Ultimately, this research endeavor aims to expand our understanding of the interplay between economic determinants and health outcomes. Through rigorous analysis and empirical investigation, it seeks to inform evidence-based policy-making and interventions aimed at promoting equitable health outcomes across diverse demographic groups.
